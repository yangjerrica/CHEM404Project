This project is used for CHEM404 group 8 written by Jerrica Yang.

It is used to process raw output data from ADMP calculations on WebMO and helped us determine the desired configuration used for transition state optimization calculation.

Contains:
1) Energy vs Time plot
2) Input orientation extraction and generate a .xyz file for VMD visualization
3) Bond distance vs Tine plot
