This project is used for CHEM404 group 8 written by Jerrica Yang.

It is used to process large raw output data from ADMP calculations (~50 MB) on WebMO and helped us determine the desired configuration used for transition state optimization calculation.

Contains:
1) Energy vs Time plot
2) Input orientation extraction and generate a .xyz file for VMD visualization
3) Bond distance vs Tine plot
